### Project Overview

 1. This project is done by using basic python operations.

2. The resultant program of this project helps to maintain student management system.

3. The project is mainly created by some concepts:
       
- Mathematical operations

- List  operations

- Dictionary operations

- String indexing and formatting


### Learnings from the project

 By completing this project, I learn more about Mathematical operations,List operations,Dictionary operations,String indexing and formatting.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this program using list operations , create two lists and pass the names.By the condition of this program we need to concatenate tha two lists and store it in a new variable.for adding a name use append() and for removing names use remove().Next create a dictionary with given keys and values and store it in a new variable.Then calculate the total and also find the Percentage of the students. By the condition of the program the school has decided to award a scholarship for the student , who performed best in mathematics from all the students for that create a Dictionary called mathematics with iven keys and values . Next stored the result in the new variable called topper.The next step is to store the student name which present in the topper should be store in the new variable called certificated_name .Thus the program is ended.


### Challenges faced

 I have just faced the indentation errors.


### Additional pointers

 Yes,The coding is very simple and i have finish it with my own ideas.
